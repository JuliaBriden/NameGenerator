# NameGenerator
Character name generator. Current datasets include Harry Potter characters and Star Wars characters. Code modified from the Pytorch Dino Name Generator (https://github.com/judahsemi/Dino-Name-Generator). Dataset from https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/zez000/characters-in-harry-potter-books.

## Cleaning data
Use data.ipynb to pre-process the name list for the LSTM deep learning model.

## Training and evaluating the model
Use name_batch.ipynb to edit the model's architecture and evaluate the model to determine most likely character names. To save models, create a folder called "model" in the saves folder.
